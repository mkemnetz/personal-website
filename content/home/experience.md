The test bed simulated aberrations caused by atmospheric disturbances, speckle, and aero-optical disturbances using a variety of phase wheels.  To model a deformable mirror a spatial-light-modulator was used.  The system was able to demonstrate real time disturbance mitigation and serves as a platform for testing more complex predictive control algorithms."""
