abstract: "A multiple aperture approach for the correction of aero-optical distortions is presented.
Measurements were conducted in Notre Dame's Tri-Sonic facility at M = 0.2 at 40kHz
with an $Ap/\\delta ≈ 6$. In this work we investigated the convective nature of the wavefront in
order to verify previous work as well as test the limits of a simply convective assumption.
We present two models for wavefront correction, a simply convective model and a linear
convolution approach. We found that for a separation of $\\Delta/\\elta \\approx 3 − 4$ a simply convective
model of wavefront propagation was not sufficient to characterize the downstream wavefront
from upstream data. POD analysis showed that although the large scale structure of
the wavefront primarily convects, the small scale structure of the wavefront quickly loses
correlation as the separation increases. The convecting-only assumption was then replaced
with the time-delayed linear convolution, where information over several sequential time
points in the upstream location were used to predict the downstream wavefront. If the
first 40 POD modes were used in predicting the downstream wavefront, the reduction of
the overall wavefront error was found to be -8 dB for the small separation of $\\Delta/\\delta = 1$ and
nearly -5 dB for the largest separation of $\\Delta/\\delta \\approx = 4$."
