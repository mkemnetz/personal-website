abstract: "In this work we examined the aero-optical component of the jitter that results from a forced shear layer.  Full 2D wavefronts were collected in Notre Dame's Tri-Sonic facility with the high speed flow set at $M = 0.6$ and the low speed flow set at $M = 0.07$.  The shear layer was forced to ensure a homogenous flow over the aperture and to supress shear layer growth.  Once the shear layer was shown to be homogenous over the aperture, the stitching method was applied.  The stitching method uses a Taylor's Frozen Flow assumption to trade time for space and stitch neighboring frames of wavefront data together.  Time series of wavefront data were acquired from the stitching method that had been corrected for aperture effects.  Finally the aero-optical component of the jitter was recovered for a forced shear layer.  The aero-optical component of the jitter from the experiment matches very well with the models developed in the paper. "
